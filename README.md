# dataStructures

An implementation of data structures mainly taken from Objects, Abstraction, Data Strctures and Design Using C++
by Elliot B, Koffman and Paul A. T. Wolfgang.

In code comments, I will use the shorthand (KF p.100) to denote p. 100 of the mentioned book.

I will implement some data structures from the book, as well as create classes used in statistics
such as the mondrian tree class.
