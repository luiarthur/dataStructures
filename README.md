# dataStructures

An implementation of data structures mainly taken from Objects, Abstraction, Data Strctures and Design Using C++
by Elliot B, Koffman and Paul A. T. Wolfgang.

In code comments, I will use the shorthand (KF p.100) to denote p. 100 of the mentioned book.

I will implement some data structures from the book, as well as create classes used in statistics
such as the mondrian tree class.

# For Drawing Trees

Need to implement tree drawing:

  - https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery

# For implement Teh and Roy's Mondrian Forest

  - https://github.com/balajiln/mondrianforest
      - To install the the required packages,
      > `$ pip install --user <package>`
      worked for all but `matplotlib`. Do `sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib` instead.
